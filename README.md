C scan disk scheduling - Disk scheduling is is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for disk. 
The disk arm again scans the path that has been scanned, after reversing its direction. 
So, it may be possible that too many requests are waiting at the other end or there may be zero or few requests pending at the scanned area.
These situations are avoided in C-SCAN algorithm in which the disk arm instead of reversing its direction goes to the other end of the 
disk and starts servicing the requests from there. So, the disk arm moves in a circular fashion and this algorithm is also similar to 
SCAN algorithm and hence it is known as C-SCAN (Circular SCAN).
